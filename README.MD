## Achievements

* Domain objects persisted in relational database via ORM
* All CRUD functionality accessible via RESTful API
* Single page web UI to consume RESTful API

* when customer buy a product, `order.service.ts `will create a cart
then customer can add product to cart, then the frontend will create a cart item with product id and quantity
* Before customer checkout, the frontend will never talk to backend.
* All the cart_item(product_id, quantity) will be saved in the frontend local storage.
* when customer checkout, he/she has to provide address and payment information. 
* `cart.service` will get the cart_item(product_id and quantity) from local storage.
* `user.service` will get the user information from the localstorage.
* `order.service`create an json object with customer_id, product_id, quantity, shipping_address and payment_info,use `httpClient` send it to backend.
##### Backend
* When `OrderController` receive the json object, it will use `UserService, AddressSerivice, OrderService` create an order with `customer_id`, `shipping_address` and `payment_info `
* First `OrderService` will create a empty order with order_id and customer_id and pending status 
* Then `OrderDao` will create a `order_item` with order_id, product_id, quantity,subtotal and save it in the database 
* Then `OrderItemDao` will update the total in the order table based on the subtotal of the `order_item` 
* After `PaymentService` verify the payment information, `OrderService` will update the status of the order to paid. 
* `OrderController` will send a json object with order_id, customer_id, shipping_address, payment_info, status, total, order_items to the frontend.
##### Back to Frontend
* After frontend `order.service.ts` receive the json object with the order infomation from the backend, `cart.service.ts` will clear the cart_item in the local storage
* Show the customer order received message

* `AuthController` will send a json object with user information and token to the frontend.
##### Back to Frontend

#### Logout
##### Frond-end
* When customer logout, the frontend 'auth.service.ts' will clear the user infomation and token in the local storage.
