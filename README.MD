[A Note About P2](https://github.com/220328-Java-Full-Stack-AWS/Curriculum-Notes/blob/main/P2.md)
## Executive Summary
The E-Commerce Single-Page Application will allow consumers to browse, search, and buy products. Users will be able to browse our catelog of products, or search for a specific item, and add these to a cart. Users can register accounts which includes a profile. There are a number of stretch goals to choose from. Please update this text to summarize additional features. This text is fairly generic, your project will be unique, this text should be re-written to reflect your final deliverable.

## Forbidden Abstractions:
 - Spring Data JPA - Spring Data JPA uses Hibernate as an ORM provider. Before we get to that level of abstraction, we will use hibernate directly ourselves.


# Functional Requirements
### Required:
 - Domain objects persisted in relational database via ORM
 - All CRUD functionality accessible via RESTful API
 - Single page web UI to consume RESTful API
 - Workflows to complete all user stories
 - Validate all user input
 - Unit test coverage for service-layer classes

### Stretch Goals:
 - Application is merged, tested, and deployed with a fully functional CI/CD Pipeline

The persistence layer shall use Hibernate ORM to translate between the database and the application server. The API layer shall abstract away the low-level servlets with Spring Web MVC. The client shall use Angular to produce an SPA which is styled to be functional and readable. The server should follow a proper layered architecture, and have adequate unit testing of the service layer. The client and server should communicate in a RESTful manner, and the server should be stateless.

 - As a user, I can browse products and add them to my cart.
 - As a user, I can remove items from my cart.

### Stretch Goals:
 - As a User, I should be able to select an amount of an item to add to my cart as I am adding an item
 - As a User, I should be able to search the product list to better find the item(s) I am interested in
 - As a User, I should be able to see and purchase items that are on sale for a lower price.
